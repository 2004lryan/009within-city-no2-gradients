## What the code does

National monitoring stations in China report hourly nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), but air quality is summarised as a city
average. The scripts here measure how NO₂ differs *within* a city, along the built-up fraction within 500 m of each
station, and ask whether vehicle electrification narrowed that contrast.

Using 1311 stations in 307 cities over 2015 to 2024, the analysis finds that, within a city and year, stations at the
ninetieth percentile of built-up exposure recorded 16.3% higher annual mean NO₂ than those at the tenth. The NO₂
gradient narrowed by 42.5% over the decade, fastest over 2017 to 2020, and the sulphur dioxide (SO₂) gradient narrowed
faster, by 84.6%. By 2020 the NO₂ gradient had completed 77% (95% interval 47% to 127%) of its 2017 to 2023
contraction and the national electric fleet 18% of its growth. In fixed-effects regressions the fleet–exposure
interaction was no longer detected once an exposure-specific trend was admitted.

## Scripts

`code/01_export_utils.py` holds the shared paths (`data/`, `outputs/`, `logs/` under the repository root) and the
workbook, figure and log helpers that every script loads.

| | `67_gradient_differential_check.py` | NO₂ minus comparison-species gradient paths |

Most scripts write their results to a workbook in `outputs/` and a log in `logs/`, both created on first run; the
acquisition scripts also write the cleaned tables under `data/`, and `50_add_o3_annual_mean.py` adds its columns to the
station panel in place. Column names, sheet names and log messages are in Chinese because the source tables use
Chinese field names; the data cards in `docs/` translate every column the analysis uses. `write_excel_workbook`
prefixes each sheet name with its position (`01_`, `02_`, …), so sheets whose titles already carry a number appear as
`01_01_…`.

## Reproducing

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt          # Python 3.13
python code/fetch_datasets.py --list     # paths and checksums of the tables the analysis reads
python code/fetch_datasets.py --verify   # after placing the tables under data/ and outputs/
```

Run every command from the repository root. The scripts find `data/`, `outputs/` and `logs/` from their own location,
but the download caches of scripts 42, 45 and 66 (under `data/raw/`, not tracked) are relative to the working
directory.

**From the cleaned tables.** With the eight tables of `data/DATA.md` in place, run scripts 47, 48, 51, 52, 54, 55 and
59 to 67 in numerical order, except that 65 must run before 64. Later scripts read the workbooks of earlier ones: 59
and 60 read that of 51, 64 reads those of 51, 61, 62, 63 and 65, and 66 reads that of 63 and downloads the GHSL 2015
tiles on first use. Script 62 reads the city meteorology workbook of script 29, one of the eight tables.

**Scripts that need the hourly files.** Scripts 56, 57 and 58, and pre-test P3 of script 47, read the hourly station
files, which are not redistributed; without them 47 skips P3 and the other three stop. Rebuild the files with

```bash
python code/42_fetch_station_air_quality.py --start 20150101 --end 20241231
```

which downloads one file for each day of 2015 to 2024, deletes each once parsed, and keeps one parquet file per year
(about 1.5 GB in total). Downloads can fail under rate limiting. The workbook `outputs/42_站点数据覆盖.xlsx` counts
the failed days of each year fetched in a run; rerunning the same command with `--only-missing` fetches only the days
absent from each year's file, and the log states for each year how many days are held and how many remain to fetch
(days the archive itself lacks stay absent). The results of the scripts that read the hourly files depend on their
completeness, and script 58 stops when the station-years it rebuilds no longer reproduce the station panel. Script 56
also reads the workbook of 48, and 58 reads those of 48, 55 and 57, so 57 runs before 58.

**Rebuilding the cleaned tables.** The acquisition scripts rebuild the tables from the public sources in this order:
42, 43, 44, 45, 29, 49, 32, 40, 37, 46 and 50. Script 44 is the road pilot, run on the first 12 stations
(`--limit 12`); it supplies only the column `加权路网密度_500m` of the station panel, and without it the panel has 57
columns and its checksum differs from `data/DATA.md`. Some sources, such as the station register and OpenStreetMap,
are live, so a rebuild will not in general reproduce the published checksums. Four inputs come from earlier-stage
preprocessing that is not included here, and 32, 37 and 40 read the vehicle-stock package placed under
`data/raw/公安部口径-新能源汽车保有量-2017_2023/` (the docstring of script 32 lists the package files the scripts
use). The package is a third-party compilation of year-end new energy vehicle registrations on the Ministry of Public
Security basis, downloaded on 2 September 2026 from a public online source under the folder name
`【2017-2023】新能源汽车保有量数据(各省市)`; no stable address is recorded for it, and script 32 checks it against the
national totals the ministry publishes. The stock tables built from it are available on request with the other
cleaned tables, and `data/DATA.md` lists all of these inputs. Scripts 29, 42 to 45 and 66 call the system `curl`, and
49 drives a locally installed Chrome, Chromium or Edge through Playwright.

## Data availability

This repository contains no data. The cleaned tables are built from public sources (national monitoring releases,
GHSL R2023A under CC BY 4.0, NASA POWER, the National Bureau of Statistics, and vehicle registration counts on the
Ministry of Public Security basis) and are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request. The hourly
files are a reformatted copy of the publisher's archive and are not redistributed. `data/DATA.md` gives the source,
licence and SHA-256 of every table.
